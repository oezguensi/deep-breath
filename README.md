# Take a deep breath!
Take a deep breath into this project that uses a Siamese Network to classify flowers. The goal of this project is to create an embedding that is capable of classifying unknown classes. This is also known as a One-Shot learning problem. 

# Goal
The main goal is to provide a baseline for the One-Shot Learning problem using a Siamese model. In particular to get a better comparison to similar approaches that make use of Autoencoders or other unsupervised learning methods.

# Data
The data containing images, labels and train/dev/test split can be downloaded [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/).
